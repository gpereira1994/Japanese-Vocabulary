# Japanese-Vocabulary
This program creates an Anki deck with japanese words that you can learn based on the kanji that you currently know. This uses the ankipandas (https://pypi.org/project/ankipandas/) and genanki (https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki) packages to create said decks. 
Procedure:
0) Install ankipandas and genanki packages
1) (Optional) If you have an Anki deck with the kanji that you know, when prompted for an input, press 1. This will generate a csv file with all card notes in your Anki profile for you to extract your kanji.
2) Populate the 'known.txt' file with the kanji that you know (the hiragana are already included)
3) Run the program once more, and when prompted, press 2 to generate the Anki deck with the words you can potentially write.
